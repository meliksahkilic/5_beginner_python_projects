# 10_beginner_python_project
I have created ten beginner python projects.

                                              #####   1. SUDOKU    *** pygame==2.0.1 is required. *** 

About:
This Script is a Sudoku Solver that solves almost any Sudoku Puzzle by visualizing through the Backtracking Algorithm which is made using the PyGame Library in Python. Ever tried but stucked on Sudoku Puzzles given in newspapers, magazines and online. You can use this script to get its solution instantly and move further.

Working:
- Every time this Script is executed, a Random Solvable board is created.
- Now, the user can first try to attempt solving it by clicking on the cells and entering values manually. Check the Input Section for the same.
- Once the the user finalizes that the inputted number is the correct entry, pressing the enter key will attempt to input the number onto the board.
- Correct answers will be permanently displayed while incorrect answers will be removed.
- Likewise, values can be removed by pressing on the backspace or delete keys.

- If at any point the player decides to solve the board, the Spacebar key can be pressed.
- This will commence a visual which will demonstrate how the backtracking algorithm works and how it is being applied in order to solve the board

Input:
Keys:	Actions
Left Click:	      Selects the Box to enter a value into that cell.
Enter:    	      Confirms the Value written on the board.
Backspace/Delete:	Deletes the value in that cell.
Space:      	    Solves the Board using the Algorithm.
h:              	Gives a Hint. Displays a random correct value on the board.


Requirements:
In order to run the Script, the require Python & PyGame and you can install the requirements using:

pip install -r requirements.txt






                                              #####  2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple Python project based on the popular Tic-Tac-Toe Game. The game’s logic is pretty simple, as a player can start this game by clicking on each grid to place the symbol ‘0’ or ‘X’.

The goal is to line up a circle or cross diagonally, vertically, and horizontally on a 3×3 square grid. The result of this game is displayed at the end of the game.

This repository contains python based interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Running Tic-Tac-Toe:
git clone https://github.com/aqeelanwar/Tic-Tac-Toe.git

                                        # Email-Slicer-with-Python

Email Slicer is the easiest but most popular Python project that will have a lot of use in the future. This Python project requires users to generate a program to retrieve the username and domain of an email. You can customize the application and send a message to the host with this information. Although it might look like a simple Python project idea, it helps you enhance your Python coding skills.
